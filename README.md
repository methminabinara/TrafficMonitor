# TrafficMonitor

This traffic monitoring system uses computer vision and deep learning to track and analyze vehicle movements at intersections. Built on YOLO v8 for detection and ByteTrack for tracking, enhanced with Kalman filtering for trajectory smoothing, it identifies four vehicle types (cars, motorcycles, buses, trucks) as they move between defined entry points ("Maligawa" and "Dalada Weediya") and exit points ("Left Lane", "Right Lane", and "KCC Road"). The system maintains vehicle identities across frames, handles occlusions, generates comprehensive traffic statistics by route and vehicle type, and produces both an annotated video output and a detailed analysis report. Notable features include robust tracking logic that can predict vehicle trajectories when temporarily lost from view, dynamic visualization with color-coded vehicle types, and detailed route analysis that captures complete vehicle journeys through the monitored area.
